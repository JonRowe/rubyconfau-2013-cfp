# Adventures in the hexagonal.

I'm passionate about TDD. I hate slow tests. I write app's that work
with Rails. I used to think 'tests,speed,rails' was a pick two problem,
now I don't. I want to talk about building rails apps; how we can use
hexagonal techniques to create better designed code, with looser
coupling.
